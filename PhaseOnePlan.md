## Phase 1 Breakdown: Small, Incremental Steps

**Progress**: 4/8 steps completed (50%) - Steps 1.1‚Äì1.4 ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### **Step 1.1: Project Setup & Basic Models** ‚è±Ô∏è *30 minutes* ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Create foundation data structures and verify project setup

- [x] Create `MethodCallInfo` class with properties:
  - [x] `Caller` (string) - fully qualified method name making the call
  - [x] `Callee` (string) - fully qualified method name being called
  - [x] `CallerClass` (string) - class containing the caller
  - [x] `CalleeClass` (string) - class containing the callee
  - [x] `CallerNamespace` (string) - namespace of caller
  - [x] `CalleeNamespace` (string) - namespace of callee
  - [x] `FilePath` (string) - source file path
  - [x] `LineNumber` (int) - line number of the call

- [x] Create `AnalysisResult` class with properties:
  - [x] `MethodCalls` (List<MethodCallInfo>) - all discovered method calls
  - [x] `MethodsAnalyzed` (int) - count of methods processed
  - [x] `FilesProcessed` (int) - count of files analyzed
  - [x] `Errors` (List<string>) - any analysis errors

- [x] Create `RoslynAnalyzer` class skeleton:
  - [x] Empty constructor
  - [x] Placeholder `AnalyzeProjectAsync(string projectPath)` method
  - [x] Placeholder `AnalyzeFileAsync(string filePath)` method

- [x] Write unit tests:
  - [x] Test `MethodCallInfo` property assignment
  - [x] Test `AnalysisResult` initialization
  - [x] Test `RoslynAnalyzer` instantiation

- [x] Verify project builds and tests pass

**‚úÖ Results**: 20 tests passing, all models working correctly, ready for Step 1.2

**üìÅ Files Created**:
- `src/CodeAnalyzer.Roslyn/Models/MethodCallInfo.cs` - Method call relationship data model

### **Step 1.2: Basic Roslyn Compilation Setup** ‚è±Ô∏è *45 minutes* ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Set up Roslyn compilation context and verify we can parse C# code

- [x] Add Roslyn NuGet packages to project (if not already present):
  - [x] `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp`
  - [x] `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces`
  - [x] `Microsoft.Build.Locator`
  - [x] `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild`

- [x] Implement basic compilation setup in `RoslynAnalyzer`:
  - [x] `CreateCompilationAsync(string projectPath)` method
  - [x] Load project using `MSBuildWorkspace`
  - [x] Get all syntax trees from project
  - [x] Create `CSharpCompilation` with references

- [x] Add reference resolution:
  - [x] Add `mscorlib` reference
  - [x] Add `System.Console` reference
  - [x] Add `System.Linq` reference
  - [x] Add project-specific references

- [x] Create test C# file for testing:
  - [x] Simple class with one method
  - [x] Place in `tests/TestData/` folder

- [x] Write tests:
  - [x] Test compilation creation with test file
  - [x] Test syntax tree extraction
  - [x] Test semantic model creation
  - [x] Verify no compilation errors

- [x] Verify we can get semantic model for test file

**Note on build warnings**: During Step 1.2, methods `AnalyzeProjectAsync` and `AnalyzeFileAsync` remain placeholders. The compiler emits CS1998 warnings because they are marked `async` without `await` yet. These will resolve naturally in Steps 1.3‚Äì1.5 when asynchronous analysis is implemented. Temporary alternatives include removing `async` and returning `Task.FromException` or inserting `await Task.CompletedTask;` before the `NotImplementedException`.

---

### **Step 1.3: Method Declaration Extraction** ‚è±Ô∏è *30 minutes* ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Extract method declarations and generate fully qualified names

- [x] Implement method extraction in `RoslynAnalyzer`:
  - [x] `ExtractMethodDeclarations(SyntaxTree tree, SemanticModel model)` method
  - [x] Find all `MethodDeclarationSyntax` nodes
  - [x] Get `IMethodSymbol` from semantic model
  - [x] Generate fully qualified names

- [x] Create `GetFullyQualifiedName(ISymbol symbol)` helper method:
  - [x] Format: `Namespace.ClassName.MethodName`
  - [x] Handle global namespace
  - [x] Handle nested types

- [x] Create test C# file with multiple methods:
  - [x] Class with 3-4 methods
  - [x] Methods in different namespaces
  - [x] Static and instance methods

- [x] Write tests:
  - [x] Test method extraction from single file
  - [x] Test fully qualified name generation
  - [x] Test namespace handling
  - [x] Verify all expected methods are found

- [x] Verify method extraction works correctly

**Notes**: Added multi-namespace test data (`MultiNamespace.cs`) and tests confirming extraction and FQN formatting for static and instance methods across namespaces.

---

### **Step 1.4: Method Call Detection (Basic)** ‚è±Ô∏è *45 minutes* ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Find method invocations and extract caller/callee relationships

- [x] Implement basic method call detection:
  - [x] `ExtractMethodCalls(SyntaxTree tree, SemanticModel model)` method
  - [x] Find all `InvocationExpressionSyntax` nodes
  - [x] Get containing method (caller)
  - [x] Get called method symbol (callee)

- [x] Handle basic cases:
  - [x] Direct method calls (`obj.Method()`)
  - [x] Static method calls (`Class.Method()`)
  - [x] Method calls within same class

- [x] Create test C# file with method calls:
  - [x] Class with methods that call each other
  - [x] Mix of instance and static calls
  - [x] Calls to external methods (Console.WriteLine)

- [x] Write tests:
  - [x] Test method call extraction
  - [x] Test caller/callee identification
  - [x] Test line number extraction
  - [x] Verify call relationships are correct

- [x] Verify basic method call detection works

**Notes**: Implemented `GetContainingMethodSymbol` for robust caller resolution; `AnalyzeFileAsync` now returns `AnalysisResult` with methods analyzed and call list. Unresolved symbols are skipped here and will be addressed in Step 1.5.

- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Verify reasonable analysis time

## Estimated Total Time: ~5 hours

**Next Phase**: Phase 2 - Call Index Builder (builds on Phase 1 results)

*This plan follows the TDD approach outlined in the architecture document. Each step builds incrementally on the previous steps, ensuring we always have working code.*
